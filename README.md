# CSS Reset 
At this point of time, this css reset draws entirely from Josh Comeau's customer baseline styles for starting a new project. Overtime, I would like to build on this example. 

Said source can be found here [Custom CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
As mentiond by Josh, this set is unopiniated, so can be readily used everywhere.
